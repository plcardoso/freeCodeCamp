## Introduction
The Colored Markers webpage is a simple HTML representation of colored markers. Each marker element is created using HTML and styled using CSS classes to simulate the appearance of different colored markers.

## Technologies
The Colored Markers webpage is built using the following technologies:
- HTML: The core language used to structure and present the marker elements.
- CSS: External styling is applied using a separate `styles.css` file.

## Usage
To explore the Colored Markers webpage, follow these steps:
1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. Observe the colored marker elements displayed on the page.
3. The markers are styled using CSS classes to create the illusion of markers with different cap and sleeve colors.

Contributions to the Colored Markers project are welcome. If you have suggestions for improvements or additional marker styles, please create a pull request or submit an issue in the repository.
